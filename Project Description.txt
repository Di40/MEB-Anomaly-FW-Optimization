Collaboration guidelines

1) Every student should adequately contribute to the final project.
2) Submitting a group project for evaluation without having 
contributed adequately to it represents academic misconduct.
3) Avoid Plagiarism. Please refrain from:
                 - Copying data, codes, spreadsheets, images, or other materials and 
using them without proper citation or acknowledgment.
        - Using material from  other students' project or a web site.
4) Please report any case of misconduct in your group.

- All written work must be your own. While you may discuss the project with other students/groups, you may not look at anyone's project.
- You must be able to explain every aspect of your project, and we reserve the right to ask you to explain how you got there.
- Don't copy stuff from the internet. Also, don't put up your project on the internet on publicly accessible places before the due date.

Project Discussion Guidelines

Discussion will be carried out on zoom (link available on the moodle page).
The discussion is divided into three parts:
1) Presentation of the project (you can use slides to speed up the process) about 20 minutes;
2) Analysis of the code and code testing;
3) Analysis of the papers (couple of questions for each student in the group).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
What you need to do? (FROM MOODLE)

- Carefully read the papers.
- Write down the code related to the papers and test it  on some given instances.
- Write an essay (on a pdf file) where you report an overview of the papers and a detailed description of the numerical experiments  you carried out.
- Choose the Exam Date from the list of the available dates.
- Upload on github (link given below) all the files THREE DAYS before the Exam Date.
- Discuss with the Professor the project you carried out.

Notice that there might be some supplementary material files for some papers.
Those papers allow you to better understand the contents.

MATERIAL
MEB and Anomaly Detection 3
- analyze in depth the papers and the theoretical results
- implement the Away-Step Frank Wolfe [Lacoste-Julien et al] PFW 
algorithm described in [Tsuji et al., Algorithm 1] and the first 
algorithm in the paper [Yildirim, 2008].
- choose two datasets (see, e.g., 
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php) and use the MEB defined 
over them to find anomalies (new points that are out of the MEB)

GITHUB
Once you are done please upload the files on github using the following link:

Here is a bunch of videos with detailed instructions for using github:

Idea of how project will go : (FROM CHATGPT)

Choose Two Datasets: Select two datasets from a source such as the UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php) or any other relevant data source. These datasets should have instances (data points) that you want to analyze for anomalies.

Minimum Enclosing Ball (MEB): The MEB is the smallest possible ball (or sphere) that encloses a given set of points. In the context of anomaly detection, the MEB represents a compact region that encompasses the majority of data points while excluding potential outliers.

Detecting Anomalies: Anomalies are data points that deviate significantly from the overall pattern of the dataset. The instruction suggests using the MEB to detect anomalies. The idea is to calculate the MEB over the entire dataset or a subset of it and then identify points that are located outside (or significantly distant from) the MEB.

Implementation Steps:

a. Calculate MEB: Implement the algorithm to compute the Minimum Enclosing Ball over the chosen dataset(s). This can involve mathematical and computational techniques to find the center and radius of the MEB.

b. Identify Anomalies: Once you have the MEB, you can determine which data points fall outside the MEB or lie at a significant distance from the MEB's boundary. These points are potential anomalies.
