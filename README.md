# MEB_FrankWolfe_Optimization

I have put neccessary information about project guidelines (taken from both mail and moodle) into "Project Descripton.txt"

Lecture notes about Frank Wolfe in folder
Papers given by prof in folder

I only added Frank Wolfe for now, but if you think there are some other sources necessary to understand papers, you can add them. Please add only necessary pages to continue focused on topic.
